            <h2>St George Discovery Page</h2>
            <p>St. George is one of the top vacation locations in Utah. The beautiful red rocks,
                topped by cooled lava plateaus highlight the colorful sunsets that grace southern Utah.
                This page highlights the best reasons to be here.</p>

                <p>This gorgeous city houses about 100,000 individuals in 32,000 households,
                    with many of those families owning businesses in St. George.
                    This city is a family friendly place to live! It is also a great retirement location,
                    with over 22% of the population being aged 65 or older, many families live near their grandparents.</p>

                <p>Beautiful red rocks cover the area of St. George Utah,
                    and a few of them have grown into formations like this one you see above.
                    These can be seen from great hiking trails that we will talk more about later.</p>

                <p>Speaking of red rocks, up behind Red Cliffs Dr are these exciting,
                    small canyons that see dozens of visitors every day.
                    Outside of these grottos are red rocks atop a cliff that can be seen from most of the city below.
                    This area is a great stomping ground for family outings and explorations.</p>

                <p>One of the many sight seeing pleasures in St.
                    George is the grounds surrounding the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints temple.
                    It is the oldest, still functioning Latter Day Saint temple in the world.
                    The people of St. George are very connected with their ancestors and this temple,
                    along with the FamilySearch center just down the road. </p>
